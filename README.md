# snake-clojure

### A Clojure project based on [Stuart Hallowayâ€™s Snake](https://github.com/stuarthalloway/programming-clojure).

Namespace is examples.snake and the core.clj file that Leiningen created has been renamed app.clj.

That file imports libraries from java.awt, javax.swing, and java.awt.event. Playing with the logic in a functional form.
